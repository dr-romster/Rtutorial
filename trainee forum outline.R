# What is data science?

#       Measurement / Data collation / curation / cleaning / sharing
#       Statistics / inference / prediction (ML/AI) 
#       Visualisation / Dissemination
#       Can be applied to all natural and life sciences

#   
# The old model: 

#  Research
#  Generate a hypothesis
#  Devise a (controlled) experiment 
#  Measure / collect data
#  Data analysis and interpretation
#  Rinse and repeat
#  Publication  
#  
#   
#  So what has changed?
#  Data availability
#      Routinely collected and stored
#      Automated
#      Easier to generate due to elentronic healthcare records
#      More people generating data (Reseach / QI)
#      Public databases with healthcare / socioeconomic / biological
#
#  Accesibility
#     Not just the data but the METHODS and TOOLS
#     Recent revolution in how programme languages are designed
#     Programming languages no longer the domain of statisticians and 
#       software engineers 
#     Domain experts (like you) can use these tools on their home computers
#       even where data is large you can use cloud computing methods 
#     Trusted research environements (TREs)
#         Sanboxed environments where priviedlged (potentially identifiable) data 
#         can be accessed and queries run to address specific problems or questions
#          Data cannot leave without approval

#   The need for a narrative
#       Data no longer just presented to super-specialist audiences 
#          (conferences and journals) but to colleagues (clinical and 
#         non-clinical) and beyond
#       The narrative can be used to
#           Disseminate new knowledge
#           Highlight problems
#           Change behaviour
#           Change policy
#                       
#     Data science offers automated workflows
#       that generate: stats / presentations / report / blog posts / dashboards

#     Yeah but I know / like / am comfortable with MS Excel
#         Excel maxes out after (18k, 2000)  1 million rows (Office 365)
#         Its great for small projects using single tables
#         The real power of excel is in its macros and more advanced commands
#            -> computer grinds to a halt
#         No reproducibility
#           You can't track your clicks and the steps you made to clean / 
#           organise your data from raw -> usable
#         New data needs to undergo the same process 
#         These steps are best done in computer program
#         Easier to address edge-cases consistently
#         Transparent methodolgy allows others to interogate and correct methods
#         Iteration improves the efficiency over time 
#     

#     Back to business: YEAH BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE AN ANAESTHETIC!
#         Data changes behaviour and practice
#         NAP-4 
#         NELA
#         National hip fracture databases (spinal vs GA)
#           Health services research
#         Pulse oximetry values in non-white individuals (MIMIC and eICU)
#

#     Data science allows us to ask questions that would only otherwise be 
#     available to specialised researchers
#       COVID H and L phenotypes
#       Intra-operative opiates
#       Tracking COVID genotypes locally

#     Gives you the tools to question / support the assertions of others
#       (especially if they are an opinion / perspective that relies on their
#         eminence)

#     It's no longer good enough to say 
#         "lets try this, it's unlikely to do any harm"
#         LOVIT trial

#     Where do I go next?

#       Find a question that interests you
#       Learn a language
#       Is this data already available? (locally, public repository)
#       Work out how to clean and organise the data
#       Come and have a chat
#       Much quicker than a biological experiment based study
#       Probably more relevant to clinical care

#   How deep does this rabbit hole go?

#       As far as you like
#           Cambrdige center for AI in healthcare
#           Big Data insttitute, University of Oxford
#           UCL Institute for Health Informatics
#           HDR UK

#   What do I get out of it?
#         
#           Problem solving
#           Using a different part of my brain that doesn't involve
#               appeasing a bit of paperwork / protocol / 
#                    broken NHS software that was never fit for purpose
#           Genuine "Eureka!" moments   
#           Collaboration
#           High turnover of questions
#           Contributing to some importanta questions in my field
#           Less exhausted by clinical workload
#           Think about how to make changes - what bit of data 
#               do I need to provide the narrative that will support changes?

#     So in summary
#       Data is NOT the new gold
#       But it is now more accessible than experimental research (which it does not replace)
#       It is not a life sentance
#       Explore for yourself how far you can get down the rabbit-hole
