# SMART Course intro to the R Language

# 1. Assignment

# Create a variable e.g. a, and assign to it a number e.g. 1


# Call the variable that you created


# Create another variable e.g. b, and assign to a text string e.g. Male



# 2. Concatenation

# Create a variable e.g. number, which contains multiple numbers e.g 1 2 3 4


# Creata a variable e.g. sex, which contains multiple text strings e.g. male, female





# Exercise 1. 

# Create a variable that contains the names: John, Paul, George, Ringo


# Create a variable that consisting of  the numbers: 200, 515, 180, 160



# Exericse 2.


# Create a data frame (e) that contains both of these elements in a table.



# Call the first column of your data frame


# Call the first row of your data frame


# Call the first column of the first row of your data frame


# Rename your data frame columns as 'Beatle' and 'Worth'


# Exercise 3.

# Create a variable x using the seq( ) function which contains the values 0 - 50 in intervals of 5.                      [Hint: type ?seq]


# Creata a variable y using the seq( ) function which contains the values 0 - 200 in steps of 20


# Use the plot( ) function to plot x and y, label the x axis: "Time"


# Create a new variable, y2 which contains the values 0 - 100 in intervals of 10.
# [hint use seq( ) ]


# Use the points( ) function to add y2 by x to your plot, using the argument 'col = red' to colour these extra points.
# [Hint: you may need to re-call the plot function to add points to it]
